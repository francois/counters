h1. Counters

Easily record any metric from anywhere within your system. Metrics are recorded to Redis (using the provided backend), in a single Hash key. You can then extract the keys later and use them with Cacti to generate graphs about anything going on.

h2. Sample Usage

Let's say you have a crawler. You'd like to record the number of URLs you visit, the number of URLs you skipped due to 304 Not Modified responses, and the number of bytes you consumed, and the amount of time each page takes to process. Here's how you'd do that:

<pre><code>require "counters"
require "rest_client"
Counter = Counters::Redis.new(Redis.new, "counters")

while url = STDIN.gets
  Counter.hit "crawler.urls"

  response = RestClient.get(url)
  Counter.magnitude "crawler.bytes.read", response.length
  next Counter.hit "crawler.urls.skipped" if response.code == 304

  Counter.latency "crawler.processing" do
    # some long and complicated processing
  end
end
</code></pre>

Redis will have a single key, named counters here, with the following keys and values in it (after 1 call with a 200 response code):

* hits.crawler.urls = 1
* magnitudes.crawler.bytes.read = 2041
* latencies.crawler.processing.count = 1
* latencies.crawler.processing.nanoseconds = 381000000

h2. Other Implementations

For testing purposes, there also exists a <code>Counters::Memory</code>. This would be good in test mode, for example. The counters are exposed through accessor methods returning a Hash.

For file logging, you should use <code>Counters::File</code>, which accepts a <code>String</code>, <code>IO</code> or <code>Logger</code> instance. All of these will be transformed to a <code>Logger</code> instance with a very strict format. All events will be logged to the file, one event per line.

<pre><code>$ irb -r counters
> Counter = Counters::File.new("counters.log")
 => #<Counters::File:0x00000101a18f18 @logger=#<Logger:0x00000101a18ef0 @progname=nil, @level=0, @default_formatter=#<Logger::Formatter:0x00000101a18ea0 @datetime_format=nil>, @formatter=#<Proc:0x00000101a18bd0@/Users/francois/Projects/counters/lib/counters/file.rb:15 (lambda)>, @logdev=#<Logger::LogDevice:0x00000101a18e28 @shift_size=1048576, @shift_age=0, @filename="counters.log", @dev=#<File:counters.log>, @mutex=#<Logger::LogDevice::LogDeviceMutex:0x00000101a18e00 @mon_owner=nil, @mon_count=0, @mon_mutex=#<Mutex:0x00000101a18d88>>>>>
